## How It Works? 🛠

This project is a wrapper around the
[AceStream middleware HTTP API](https://docs.acestream.net/developers/start-playback/#using-middleware), allowing both
[HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) and
[MPEG-TS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) playback
of a stream.

I was tired of the limitations of AceStream and some of the problems that 
exist when playing a stream 📽. For example, it is only possible to play
the same channel for **1 single client**. For having multiple clients
playing **different streams**, you must manually add a unique `pid` per 
client. If there was an error during the transmission, the **whole stream
goes down**, etc.

I found quite frustrating the experience of using AceStream in a home network
with a single server and multiple clients, to try to optimize resources. This
is the topology for which I am using AceStream:

There are some problems:

* Only **one client** can play the same stream at a time 🚫.
* Having each client to run AceStream on their own is a waste of resources
  and saturates the network 📉.
* Multiple clients can play different streams if they have a unique `pid`
  (Player ID) associated 🔓.
* The standard AceStream HTTP API is not resilient enough against errors,
  if the transmission stops it stops for every client ❌.

## Key Features 🔗

When using `acexy`, you automatically have:

* A single, centralized server running **all your AceStream streams** ⛓.
* Automatic assignation of a unique `pid` (Player ID) **per client per stream** 🪪.
* **Stream Multiplexing** 🕎: The same stream can be reproduced *at the
  same time in multiple clients*.
* **Resilient, error-proof** streaming thanks to the HTTP Middleware 🛡.
* *Blazing fast, minimal proxy* ☄ written in Go!

With this proxy, the following architecture is now possible:

## Usage 📐

`acexy` is available and published as a Docker image. Make sure you have
the latest [Docker](https://docker.com) image installed and available.

The latest release is available at the [releases page](/releases/latest),
but picking a fixed version is recommended. To run the container, just issue:

```shell
docker run -t -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/javinator9889/acexy
```

> **NOTE**: For your convenience, a `docker-compose.yml` file is given with
> all the possible adjustable parameters.

By default, the proxy will work in MPEG-TS mode. For switching between them,
you must add the **`-m3u8` flag** or set **`ACEXY_M3U8=true` environment
variable**.

> **NOTE**: The HLS mode - `ACEXY_M3U8` or `-m3u8` flag - is in a non-tested
> status. Using it is discouraged and not guaranteed to work.

There is a single available endpoint: `/ace/getstream` which takes the same
parameters as the standard
[AceStream Middleware/HTTP API](https://docs.acestream.net/developers/api-reference/). Therefore,
for running a stream, just open the following link in your preferred application - such as VLC:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/ace/getstream?id=dd1e67078381739d14beca697356ab76d49d1a2
```

where `dd1e67078381739d14beca697356ab76d49d1a2` is the ID of the AceStream 
channel.

## Optimizing 🚀

The AceStream Engine running behind of the proxy has a number of ports that can
be exposed to optimize the performance. Those are, by default:

- `8621/tcp`
- `8621/udp`

> NOTE: They can be adjusted through the `EXTRA_FLAGS` variable - within Docker - by
> using the `--port` flag.

Exposing those ports should help getting a more stable streaming experience. Notice
that you will need to open up those ports on your gateway too.

For reference, this is how you should run the Docker command:

```shell
docker run -t -p 8080:8080 -p 8621:8621 ghcr.io/javinator9889/acexy
```

### Alternative 🧃

AceStream underneath attempts to use UPnP IGD to connect against a remote machine.
The problem is that this is not working because of the bridging layer added by Docker
(see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/).

If you are running a single instance of Acexy - and a single instance of AceStream -
it should be safe for you to run the container with *host networking*. This means:

- The container **can access** any other application bridged to your main network.
- You **don't need** to expose any ports.
- Performance **is optimized** a little bit.

> NOTE: This only works on Linux environments. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/
> for more information.

The command is quite straightforward:

```shell
docker run -t --network host ghcr.io/javinator9889/acexy
```

That should enable AceStream to use UPnP freely.

## Configuration Options ⚙

Acexy has tons of configuration options that allow you to customize the behavior. All of them have
default values that were tested for the optimal experience, but you may need to adjust them
to fit your needs.

> **PRO-TIP**: You can issue `acexy -help` to have a complete view of all the available options.

As Acexy was thought to be run inside a Docker container, all the variables and settings are
adjustable by using environment variables.
